* A problem that prevented you from hiding the Wiki in the list of Pages when
  using Firefox is resolved. (STUD-1581)

* A problem that prevented you from importing a course created on edx.org into
  edX Edge is resolved. (STUD-1599)

***************************************
edX Learning Management System
***************************************

* The Instructor Dashboard that is presented to course teams by default in the
  LMS has changed. The Instructor Dashboard that is presented when you click
  **Instructor** is now the "New Beta" dashboard. The "Standard" dashboard
  remains available; a button click is required to access it. The two dashboard
  versions are also relabeled in this release. The version that was previously
  identified as the "New Beta Dashboard" is now labeled "Instructor Dashboard",
  and the version previously identified as the "Standard Dashboard" is now
  labeled "Legacy Dashboard". (LMS-1296)

  The **Staff Debug** viewer for problems is enhanced to include options to
  adjust a student's grades. On the viewer, you can identify the student by
  username or email address, and then select **Reset Student Attempts**,
  **Delete Student State**, or **Rescore Student Submission**.

* Previously when a student clicked **Run Code** for a MatLab problem, the
  entire page was reloaded. This issue has been resolved so that now only the
  MatLab problem elements are reloaded. (LMS-2505)
